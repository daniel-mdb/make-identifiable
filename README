It became harder to debug modern c++ code due the proliferation of
anonymous lambdas.

This "demo" injects a function preamble through the "identify" macro
into any function, which upon a call prints its name, source file and
line.

TODO:
 - deduce the proper type for our identifiable_function.
 - suggest change into compiler.
